During my internship as a developer, 
I provided support by addressing tickets, managing databases, and programming solutions to improve processes. 
I gained hands-on experience in troubleshooting, enhancing database performance, and developing code that streamlined operations. 
This internship allowed me to refine my technical skills and deepen my understanding of real-world development challenges.
