As a Backend Developer specializing in PHP, 
I worked extensively with CodeIgniter, Laravel, and Symfony to build and maintain robust backend systems. 
I also collaborated on front-end development using Angular, incorporating AB testing to optimize user experience and engagement. 
My role involved implementing unit testing for backend services to ensure code quality and reliability. 
This experience allowed me to integrate diverse technologies effectively, enhancing both the functionality and performance of the applications.
