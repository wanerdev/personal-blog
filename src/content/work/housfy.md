As a Full Stack Developer specializing in PHP, I played a key role in developing and maintaining APIs, which were crucial for delivering efficient and reliable backend services. 
I employed Domain-Driven Design (DDD) with a hexagonal architecture to ensure the system's modularity and adaptability, making it easier to manage and scale. Additionally, 
I integrated unit testing into the development process to maintain high standards of code quality and reliability. This approach not only streamlined the development workflow but also contributed to the stability and performance of the applications.
